## Layouts

There are currently five pre-defined layouts available for the Chameleon skin.

### `standard`

The `standard` layout features a head area with a [logo](../components/Logo.md),
[personal tools](../components/PersonalTools.md) and a [search
bar](../components/Searchbar.md). This area is separated from the [main
content](../components/MainContent.md) area by a horizontal menu bar holding the
main navigation items.

### `navhead`

Has a full-width horizontal navbar at the top and a near full-width toolbar at
the bottom of the page. [Logo](../components/Logo.md),
[personal tools](../components/PersonalTools.md) and [search
bar](../components/Searchbar.md) are integrated in the navbar.

### `fixedhead`

Same as `navhead`, but the navbar remains visible when the page is scrolled
down.

### `stickyhead`

same as `fixedhead`, but it has a smaller secondary navbar on top of the regular
navbar that is only visible when the page is all the way up and will be hidden
when the page is scrolled down.

### `clean`

Same as `navhead`, but the navbar and toolbar are only visible to users with the
*edit* right. The idea here is to have the navbar and toolbar available for
admins etc., but hidden to the normal site visitor.
