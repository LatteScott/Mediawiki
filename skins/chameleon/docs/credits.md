### Included libraries

The following libraries are included:
* [HC-Sticky](https://github.com/somewebmedia/hc-sticky), a dependency free
  javascript library that makes any element on your page visible while you
  scroll. Author: [Some Web Media](http://somewebmedia.com)


### Dependencies

The Chameleon skin uses several other libraries. These, while not included
directly in, nor delivered with the code, are pulled in automatically by the
Composer tool during installation. These are:
* MediaWiki Bootstrap extension, which provides the Twitter Bootstrap
  framework (version 4) to other MediaWiki extensions and skins. Author: Stephan
  Gambke. See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Bootstrap
* Bootstrap 4, the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for
  developing responsive, mobile-first projects on the web. Maintained by the
  [Bootstrap team](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/about/team/). See
  http://getbootstrap.com/
* Font-Awesome, a full suite of pictographic icons for easy scalable vector
  graphics on websites, created and maintained by Dave Gandy. See
  http://fontawesome.io/
* scssphp, a compiler for SCSS written in PHP. Author: Leaf Corcoran. See
  http://leafo.github.io/scssphp/  
* loads of other software that I either forgot, am not aware of or that should
  be obvious (e.g. PHP, MediaWiki, etc.)

### Thanks!

To all the above people and projects my sincere thanks. This skin would not be
possible without them.

If I forgot somebody, sorry. Please drop me a note, so I can add them here.
